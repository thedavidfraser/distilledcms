# distilledcms

Distilled CMS generates the DOM as levels. Every level starts with a heading and can only contain one heading. Optional content follows the heading. 

Each level's heading and optional content are grouped together as "level content". Each level can contain any number of other levels after its own "level content".

## index.html and start.html

Start HTML is an "empty" HTML document which is populated by generated content by Distilled CMS.

Index HTML is a static copy of the above ready for production. Currently this is produced by cut-n-paste in the browser.
